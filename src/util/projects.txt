# :notes: Soundly

Soundly is a simple, easy to use music player built for Windows. It provides a minimalistic interface
for adding and customising music. The goal with the design of the app was to reduce choice fatigue, and to reduce time exploring.

Soundly allows you to add music from sources like youtube or your local file system. The songs can be added as a playlist or as an individual song.

# Spellify

Spellify is a simple web-app built with NextJS, designed to improve
comprehension skills. It uses the native voice synthesis api present
on the Browser and generates spelling prompts in which the user has to listen to the generated word and spell it correctly.

The user must choose between three levels of difficulty:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

The number of prompts and lengths of words increases with each difficulty level. The user can see their score, and their spelling accuracy. The user can also practice incorrect words and hone their spelling.

<br/>

A pomodoro timer that plays lofi (or any) music from youtube while you do your thing. 
It's a rewrite of the same react app that I wrote over a year ago, now with Nextjs & Typescript.

# Usage

<br/>
 You first set a duration for the timer, then the duration of the break interval, and then hit play. You can click the reset button to reset the timer completely,
 or pause it with the pause button. Clicking the ðŸŽœ icon will open up the youtube player and an input box where you can enter your video link. It can be any youtube video,
 or a livestream. While the timer runs, the music will play in the background. If you give the site notification access, you'll also get a notification whenever a break interval starts.
 
 
# Installation
Clone the project, then run
```bash
yarn install
```
You can then run the tests with 

```bash 
yarn test
yarn cypress:open 
```
A static file is built with next's static site generation:
```bash
yarn export
```
